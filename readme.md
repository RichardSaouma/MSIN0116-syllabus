## Policies
  1. **Attendance.** Attendance is critical. If you have extenuating circumstances that are going to keep you out of class, please inform me in advanced as early as possible.
  
  2. **Class decorum.** Treat our time in the classroom as you would meeting with the executive team or board of directors of your company. This means listening to and respecting the perspectives of your peers. It also means speaking up and disagreeing when you have a different opinion.

  3. **Technology.** Active engagement by all students is a critical part of this module, especially during our discussions. As a result, the default rule is for all laptops, tablets, phones, etc. to be muted and off the desk.
  
  If you have circumstances that require an exception to this rule, please discuss with me.

  There will be occassions when laptops will be used. I will let you know when they are needed.

  4. **Class Norms.** I would like to make explicit some norms that I hope are wholly embraced in the classroom.
      - Arrive to class on time and prepared to contribute
      - Take risks with your ideas
      - Speak in class if you have a question
      - Embrace failure and the iterative nature of learning and discovery
      - Speak up if you disagree
      - And finally, *do not* wait until you have *the perfect* comment to raise your hand and speak in class
      <!-- - Importance of listening -->

  5. **Guests.** Guests are welcome to attend class. Friends, colleagues who are interested in the program, and family are all invited. Please email me the name of your guest the day before class. At the start of class I will ask you to introduce the guest to your peers and I encourage the class to make our guests feel welcome. I request that you inform your guests to remain as observers during the class.

  6. **Food and Drink.** In line with the UCL School of Management norms, please refrain from bringing food or drinks (water bottles are OK) into the class.
  
## Assessment
Assessment is based on class participation, an individual assignment, and a team project.

### Class Participation (20%)
This course depends on the participation of all the students. Active engagement promotes a more lively discussion and debate. It is in the exchange of ideas that new and interesting ways of thinking about the concepts in the course emerge. The level and quality of your participation will be part of your assessment.
  
To promote participation, students may be "cold" or "warm" (where I write the names of students who are on notice they will be called during that class block).

### Individual assignment (45%)
Individual assessed assignments will consist of one written submission.

### Team project (35%)
Students are asked to form teams and produce a culminating project. Teams will consist of up to five students. Your team may choose one of two project types. Project types are flexible and I invite teams to craft the project that best suits their interests.
  
  1. **Data project.** You are the data team of your firm and you are presenting a research project to executive management as a means for better understanding the business. This could include a study of customers, transactions, sales performance, costs, etc. Identify a dataset of interest to your team. Frame your study question and then conduct the appropriate analysis, provide a result and next steps (e.g. policy recommendation, follow on research agenda, a design for an experiment).

  2. **Data-based business proposal.** For students who are considering entrepreneurial activities after graduation, you have the opportunity to act as an entrepreneurial team pitching a new business idea to an audience of startup mentors and investors. Your startup involves data-based or platform services. Craft a "business plan" (with an emphasis on the strategy-related aspects of the plan, including value proposition, competitive positioning, business model, etc.)

## Honor Code
By taking this module, you are agreeing to maintain a high level of academic and professional integrity. For your work, this means citing sources wherever appropriate and producing work that is your own. Cheating, plagiarizing, or misrepresenting one's work are a violation of our classroom's aspirational norms and the program's code of conduct.

## Software
Because we focus on underlying principles, I do not require the use of any specific software or tools. For required work, it is the student's responsibility to understand the problem, identify a path towards solution, and implement that path how he or she sees fit.

Having said that, I provide supplemental resources for students to study the tools and implementation of the approaches we discuss in class. Those resources will refer to the following software:

- [MS Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel) and [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/). Spreadsheets.
- [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/). Data visualization tool.

If you intend on using a programming language to produce your work, I highly suggest [R](https://www.r-project.org) and/or [Python](https://www.python.org). Each has its comparative strengths and those most immersed in analytics in industry typically work with both languages. Here are a few resources for each:
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
- [Model Analytics Python Tutorial](https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/)
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)

## Datasets and Data Repositories
